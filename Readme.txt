README for OpenSong V1.0 Beta 2 BL10
7 April 2006

Beta 2 BL10 is an update to the March release.  This release fixes
several high-priority bugs in printing and song display.  See the
changelog for full details.

There are three ZIP files as part of this release:

* Beta2-10-Src.zip contains the RealBasic .rb file, the new English
  language file, the Images subdirectory with all the .jpg files that
  are part of the project, and a changelog for the language file.

* Beta2-10-Win.zip contains the Windows executable program,
  the English language file and the changelog.

* Beta2-10-OSX.zip contains the Macintosh OS X executable program,
  the English language file and the changelog.

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT:

If you have not previously installed OpenSong on your system, download
and install the appropriate V0.9.9 release to create the proper
directories and default files on your computer.  This release only
contains the changed files.  This is the same as the V1.0 Beta 1 release.
A formal installer will be provided for V1.0.

Installation instructions:

1. Rename your existing OpenSong executable file to something different,
   such as OpenSong099.exe for Windows.  On Windows, this will usually be
   found in your C:\Program Files\OpenSong folder.  On OS X, look in
   Applications:OpenSong.

2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file for your operating system,
   specifying the OpenSong program folder.  Alternatively, expand the
   ZIP into a temporary folder, then copy OpenSong to the application
   folder.  The English file should be placed in the OpenSong Languages
   folder beneath the main program folder.

As of this release, issues should be logged through the normal SourceForge
tracking system.  This includes both bugs and wishlist items.  Help and
general discussion can go to either the Help forum or the 0.99->1.0 forum.

Beta 2 is considered "feature complete" for the V1.0 release. No
additional features are planned prior to V1.0.
