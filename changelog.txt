-= BL18 =-

* FIXED Closing SongPicker would actually insert the currently selected song [Bug 1720935]

* Correct the output of the bible index to avoid truncating the last character of each entry. [Bug 1718177]

-= 1.0.2 BL18 =-

* Include minor changes to help correct presenter issues in versions compiled with RB200x.

* Fix issue with margins display in Print Settings.  In Mac UB, correct stacking order for labels in the Print Settings dialog.

* In ScripturePicker, change the default button to Insert after first Insert (live display from ScripturePicker without adding to set). The
operator only has to press Enter to move forward after that point.

* Prevent NilObjectException in lst_set_items.change

* Add conditional check to pop_scr_version.change to see if we are initializing (fixes preview text not showing)

-= 1.0.1 BL17 =-

* Correct issue where subfolder entries in a FolderDB cache would be corrupted, rendering them inaccessible.  See the JRC source tree for editorial comments.  :-)

-= 1.0.0 BL17 =-

* Removed unused vars in lst_songs_songs.changed

* Fix corner case in SongEditor where user would click in an empty row of the song list and has unsaved changes,those changes would be lost

* Prevent Second Save prompt when renaming set(Bug 1700769)

* Fix issue where the list of verses for a book wouldn't be displayed if the book has non-ASCII characters. [Bug 1706973]

* Rebuilding the song folder cache will complete one folder before beginning its subfolders to reduce the number of times the status window blinks.

* Fix issue where OpenSong would quit if the documents folder saved in the preferences did not exist, leaving users with no easy way to repair the problem since the folder is a Base 64 encoded string holding the value of FolderItem.GetSaveInfo.

* Add AbsolutePath to the info saved with a FolderItem in a preferences file.  OpenSong ignores this value when reloading the FolderItem, but it is useful for debugging.

* When new scripture version is selected, don't reload the scripture if the new version is the same as the currently loaded version.

* Release Bible object before loading new version.  Improves, but does not fully correct, a memory leak when changing bibles. [Bug 1703561]

* Correct an issue introduced in r166 on IndexProgress where it wouldn't close properly after the scripture index is written. Also set IndexProgress window properties to prevent resizing.

* Made printing the presentation order on the leadsheet optional.  The default is to not print it and produce the same output as RC1-BL14. Add <leadsheet presentation="true"/> to your PrintSettings file to enable.  Post-V1 will address this a different way; for now it provides a workaround for those who don't need or want the presentation order printed.

(r166)
* On Mac OSX, corrected module installation menu item to correctly allow selection of the module file.

* Changed scripture indexing progress window to a global floating window to address issue with window stacking order.  To cancel index creation now, close the window with the close box.

* When installing a scripture module, ask to build the index during installation. [Feature Request 1695997]

* Scripture index creation won't crash the program if the user doesn't have the appropriate privileges to write the index. [Bug 1695995]

* Correct NilObjectExceptions when printing a set list or songs in a set.

-= 1.0 Release Candidate 2, Baselevel 16 =-

* Reworked change from revision 154 for PresentWindow exit dialog. Program now will use the operating system message box ONLY if in single screen mode. This avoids the message box appearing on the presentation screen if the last window with the focus was the presentation window.

* Export Song to HTML will not include capo chords if the "print capo chords" flag is not set. [Bug 1695098]

* Corrected internal logic bug in the scripture picker.

* Closing a presentation by focusing on the presentation display while a dialog box is open no longer causes problems and a crash later. [Bug 1693567]

* If scripture file is not found at program start, prompt for the file to use.  Added scripture_lookup/select_file to English translation.

(r154)
* Exit dialog for PresentWindow changed from InputBox to an operating system message box to correct issue where the dock and menu bar would not hide after prompting for exit and the user selecting Cancel to return to the presentation. (added in r154 but not documented in commit message)

* Updated English translation to make a better distinction between the two CCLI numbers: the church license number and the song CCLI ID number.

* Correct issue introduced in BL15 where the default style would be used instead of the song style if song_style_preferred is False and a style change is not active.

* Fix mouse getting stuck on the hourglass after presentation.

* Fix PresentWindow on Mac so the resize box does not appear. As a temporary side effect, the window cannot be sized or moved when using dual-screen preview mode.

* Mouse cursor properly changes when over PresentWindow even if the window does not have focus.

* Corrected error in saving custom slides where the starting characters of the final slide would be dropped if the slides contained multi-byte characters. (OpenSongUtils.SplitRE) (Bug 1668194)

(r149)
*Update style.css to include hymn number & presentation order

*Include hymn numaber & presenation order in HTML export

* A meaningful error message is displayed if the language file is missing. The user is given the option of selecting a new language.

* Added main_menu/edit/selall to English translation file. (Bug 1651194)

* Fix single screen mode on Mac to properly remove the menu bar when OpenSong regains focus from another program. (Related to Bug 1512764).

* Eliminate indexing or presentation of non-space whitespace characters in scriptures. (Bug 1658650)

(r147)
* Added update to MainSettingsWindow from r146, resizing nte_documents_warning.

* Updated version to baselevel 16 (was getting harder to keep track of when certain changes in BL15 were made).

* Changed PresentWindow to remain invisible after creation until late in the Present method to minimize visible changes to the window as it is configured.

* Additional changes to PresentWindow to address issues with inconsistent window updates at start of a presentation. (Bugs 1559351 and 1658099)

-= 1.0 Baselevel 15 =- Revision 145

* Fixed a couple of bugs introduced with the preferences file that caused a crash if the file did not exist.

* Change help shortcut key on OSX to Command-? to more closely conform to the Apple UI standards. Command-H is most commonly used for Hide.

* Clean up error handling if the main preferences file didn't load properly. (JRC r141)

* Removed OpenSongUtils.Xor (not used and incompatible with RB2007r1)

* Moved FormatFolderName from MainSettingsWindow to FileUtils.  That's probably a more appropriate place for a utility function that may come in handy elsewhere.

* In a previous change, MainWindowSettings was modified to only change the location of the documents folder in the preferences, not the running program.  This means that OpenSong may continue to safely run against the old folder.  The forced exit was removed and the prompts changed.

* Added NotifyReceivers method to the IPreferences interface.  No sense being able to register callbacks without a way to make them, eh?

* On Macintosh, Presenter mode will not minimize the main window to the dock, nor restore it when leaving Presenter. 

* Trap NilObjectException in SmartML.XDocFromFile. An error before the translator is loaded, or in loading the translator, could cause OpenSong to chase its tail trying to display the error.

* Added Tagalog books to bnames.xml (book names for Zefania).

* Main preferences dialog updated to show the folder in use for songs and sets.  Some controls in this dialog are resized to accommodate the Slavic and Germanic languages.  Settings are stored in the new preferences file (see next item).

* The Globals file, while contained within the application's directory tree, is written to by any user on the computer.  This created an issue for security-conscious users who desired to have non-Admin accounts run OpenSong.  It also created an issue where multiple users on the same computer wanted to use non-standard directories to hold OpenSong song and set files.  The Globals file now will be used for just that: global defaults set by the system administrator.  The user-level defaults derived from Globals now go into a proper user-specific preferences file, stored in ~/Library/Preferences on Mac, \Documents and Settings\{user}\Application Data\OpenSong on Windows, and ~/.OpenSong on Linux.  This is still an XML file, but it uses the PLIST DTD rather than OpenSong's old format.

* SmartML.GetValueB wasn't setting the default in the XML if the path had to be created.  This meant that GetValueB would create a path with no value (interpreted as False) even if the default was set to True, so the next call to GetValueB on that path would return False always on subsequent calls until SetValueB was called.

* Provide method to globally configure that a set style change overrides the style defined for a song (configured by editing the setting of "song_style_preferred" in the PresentSettings file).  Default is true, the current behavior.  This is a temporary workaround, not a permanent fix.

* Fixed scripture indexing to avoid dropping words from the index completely. [Bug 1651524]

* Corrected cosmetic issue with text entry field for scripture lookup direct entry.

* Program preferences window rearranged; documents folder path displays on main page; browse for new documents documents folder starts at current documents folder.

* Scripture lookup will no longer crash if the reference returns no verses.

* Scripture lookup will no longer crash if a reference is typed into the edit field and the Lookup button or Return is pressed. (Thanks, JS, for all the testing help!)

* Fixed error with copyright subtitle text displayed on slides.

* Changed prompts the user sees to save a set (not an item within a set, though).  User now has three options like the previous change to Songs.  If the user selects "Don't Save," there are two possible actions: revert to the last saved version, or continue with the unsaved copy.  The behavior is controlled by two options in the MainSettings file: set_revert_on_dont_save and song_revert_on_dont_save.  At this time, these must be manually edited to change the default value.

* Prevent bizarre second prompt for unsaved changes to a Song when exiting

* Fixed Style Change set item to allow Subtitle Options

* Fixed remembering previously selected From & To Verses when changing Bibles in ScripturePicker

* Moved subtitle creation from SongML.ToSetML to new method SongML.BuildSubtitles to enhance readability and maintainability.

-= 1.0 RC 1 Baselevel 14 =-

* Running Presenter from Song mode will now display using the song's specific style rather than the default style.

*Added Bible Book label to ScripturePicker

*Fixed presenting song subtitles that somehow got broken -- badly. Descriptive Subtitles had no chance of working.

*Fixed ScripturePicker can now select Genesis & Matthew (Silly Ed :)

*Remember previously selected folder in SongPicker

*Partial Support for remembering previously selected Book, Chapter & Verse when changing Bibles in ScripturePicker

*Verse & Paragraph rad buttons in ScripturePicker now update preview

*Add text the Scripture preview when starting ScripturePicker

*Changed the way we prompt for unsaved changes to a song, to Yes,No,Cancel [Bug 1468060]. Still on the "to do" list is to fix this all throughout OpenSong, so additional bug reports aren't necessary...we want this as much as you do.  Deleted SaveDialog class previously added to code but not used (a utility routine is sufficient).

*Prompt for unsaved changes before importing song

*Prompt for unsaved changes before exporting single song

*Removed second save prompt when moving song

*Prevent OutOfBounds Exception when Removing unsaved set item

* Set conditional compiles to support building Mach-O targets on Mac (OS X-only binary).  Source now compiles for Mac without change on RB2006 r4.  Mac binaries will now be distributed in bundle format (OpenSong.app vs. single file).

* New "About" dialog.  Updated contributors list.

* Added more error traps to the Image Chooser Window (used for selecting background images) in an effort to resolve bug 1604503.

-= 1.0 Beta 2 Baselevel 13 =-

* Reworked application and window Activate and KeyDown events to better detect when the wrong window has keyboard focus in presentation mode.  This clears up issues on the Mac with OpenSong appearing to hang in single-screen mode. [Bug 1575609]

* Corrected resizing issues with Scripture Search and added scripture_search/lst_result tag to English translation file to translate the listbox headers. [Bug 1495537]

* Corrected UI oddities in Scripture Search (default and enabled buttons for given dialog states).

* Corrected numerous UI oddities in Scripture Picker: Lookup button enables only with text in the lookup box; dialog default button changes to Done after a lookup; clicking on the current Bible book name won't reset the chapter and verse sliders.

* Maximize/restore button in Windows will correctly update the Full/Normal screen selection in the Presentation Helper window, and vice-versa.  On Macintosh and Linux, Maximize will not use the full client area on the control window to work around an issue with the top of the window hiding behind the menu bar on the Mac. [Bug 1559271]

* Song selection window only opens once if activated immediately after entering presenter mode and no song is inserted.

* Song selection window ("Q" shortcut in presenter) list of songs changes the highlighted song name with Page Up/Page Down/Home/End keys in keeping with commonly accepted UI practices. [Bug 1559333]

* ActionSongPrint and ActionSongPrintAll now pass the song file's path to LeadSheet.AddSong.  This clears up an issue where the highest file in the folder hierarchy would be used regardless of the one selected if there are duplicate filenames in different folders.

* Export to HTML (SongML.ToHTML) properly encodes characters such as the ampersand (&), greater/less-than (<>), etc.  Added a method to the OpenSongUtils module to extend the String class so this can be used elsewhere. Thanks to the Multi-byte String Utilities project (http://sourceforge.jp/project/php-i18n/) for the table to match UTF-8 code points to the proper HTML encoding. [Bug 1607916]

* Find now will correctly locate a string within a theme. [Bug 1584929]

* The selection of current song folders in both the song editor and song selection for sets are now "sticky," in other words, they retain their settings when the windows are reopened. [Feature Request 1543453]

* Printing a lead sheet with a hymn number no longer garbles the title. [Bug 1477629]

* Lead sheets include the presentation order as part of the header. Added language tag songml/presentation.

* HTML files created by the Export to HTML function are tagged as using the UTF-8 character set. [Bug 1477964]

* Fix issue in ImageChooserWindow where non-picture, non-folder files would cause a NilObjectException. [Bug 1604503]

* Browsing out of ImageChooserWindow for a picture now permits Mac users to actually select something. [Bug 1495745]

* Prevent Resizing MainWindow when closing presentation.

* Fixed bug where two blank set items would be added to the beginning of a set when the set's first item is a style change

* Fixed numerous issues with freeform scripture lookup.  The list of verses in a chapter may have gaps in the numbering if the text of the scripture merges verses.  Subverses are now properly handled in Zefania-format scripture. [Bug 1468053]

* Fixed race condition where the main window, presentation window and presentation helper window would activate each other when exiting presenter mode. (Windows only)

* Changed method for retrieving verses included in a selected scripture to better handle conditions where the verses are not sequentially numbered. [Bug 1468053]

* Changed superclass of the About menu to AppleMenuItem to relocate it to the application menu per Apple's interface guidelines.  Does not affect Windows or Linux.

* A bible with an empty chapter or book won't cause the indexing process to error out.

* Indexing process subtly altered to be more "friendly" to documents with non-ASCII characters.  This relies on the RealBasic regular expression library definition of "word characters," which understands UTF-8 characters but may not be 100% accurate.  Users should report errors in an index that are caused by characters in the user's alphabet that are not included in the index.

* Fixed typo in English translation (does not affect any tags).

* Default scripture search options to "contains" and "all words."

* Printing a long line no longer drops a letter at the wrap point if the maximum width line included part of a word rather than white space at the end.

* The Present Helper window will be restored when the Presenter is activated if Present Helper was minimized.  [Bug 1479332]

* When modifying a style, the visualization of the selected image uses the style's background color to fill areas not covered by the image (for example, when Center Image is selected and the image aspect ratio isn't the same as the display's aspect ratio.

* Fixed the window for selecting scripture to allow for resizing on Macintosh and disallow minimize on Windows.  Since this is a modal dialogue box, the latter could make OpenSong appear to not be responding and an inexperienced user may not realize the dialogue needs to be restored from the task bar.

* When printing a line with chords and no lyrics, print capo chords in the correct font. [Bug 1483807]

* Changed FolderDB and Open event of ScripturePickerWindow to only look at files where the Visible attribute is True.  FolderDB was already ignoring files that start with an underscore or period, but this corrects potential issues with hidden files in a more general way.

* Presenter will now run for a set with picture slides only (custom slides with a style but no body).  Correcting this error also corrected an unreported error where OpenSong would treat the string "---" as a slide separator regardless of it's position on the line.  It now must be on a line of its own with no leading or trailing spaces. [Bug 1560097]

* Fixed NilObjectException error when slide style is added to a set.  Somehow this got totally broken.

* Corrected issue with fields not properly updating when a song is created. [Bug 1590566]

* Moved subtitle selection from Presentation Settings to the style editor.  Corrected issue where a song with a custom style would use the subtitles from the default style instead of the custom style.

* Corrected logic error selecting language translation on General Settings/OpenSong Preferences dialog box.

* Corrected some window manipulation issues entering and leaving Presenter.

* Translated several SmartML error Messages

* Bring SongPicker, ScripturePicker & InputBox to front when OpenSong is Re-activated in Preview Dual Screen Mode

* Translated Additional Dev About string

* Return Nil translator Object if file passed is Nil or Non-existent(switched to cozmics method)

* Translated help

* Translated Browse for Folder Title

* Prevent OutOfBounds Exception when removing set item

* Translated Scripture Search Window

* Adjusted PresentHelper to fit spanish translation

* Resized txt_style_transition_note to fit spanish translation

* Fixed Help text for Containing Folder, Transpose, Print Capo, custom order, original order, slide style, & setitem list

* Fixed Several Presentation Window problems

* Added Option to overwrite debug log files


* In set mode, name of new custom slide is now a translatable item instead of "Untitled."

* Corrected issue with invalid song path in set on Macintosh.  Would've also affected Linux song files with spaces in the name. [Bug 1567295]

* Fix "create song" to add folder info to the song listbox.

* Fix "move song" to properly update the folder info stored in the song listbox. Also, a more informative error message is given if the song already exists in the destination folder. [Bug 1565098]

* Support selecting all monitors when system has more than two monitors. [Bug 1554999]

* Update PrintSettings XML at program start to use points as units of measurement.

* Set focus to edit field when InputBox opens.

* Started work on SImageCanvas to allow more flexibility in setting the picture.

* Fix NilObjectException when creating a new song [Bug 1563081]

* Bring PresentWindow to front in Single Screen Mode
    
* Added Ability to search songs by Hymn Number

* Added translation support for set item identifiers (custom, song, style, etc.). [Bug 1500189]

* Completed translation support for all reports.

* Changed set list report to indicate the type of item in the item title.

* New feature: custom slides will show a separator line at slide breaks when printing a set list.

* If a Zefania format bible is loaded and the "bname" attribute is added from bnames.xml, prompt the user before writing the changed file.  If the user chooses not to save, supress generating the index file. [Bug 1467699]

* InputBox on Windows forces itself to the top of the window stack so it doesn't get hidden behind the splash window or other floating windows. [Bug 1467699]

* Added code to the "last chance" exception handler to recognize what kind of error was raised.  This isn't particularly useful now, but will be when the handler can produce a stack dump after OS moves to RB2006 or later.

* Changing the style of a song marks the song as changed but does not ask the user immediately if it should be saved. [Bug 1512827]

* Added translation support in Bible for previously hard-coded English messages.  Also changed use of MsgBox to InputBox for UI consistency. [Bugs 1500189, 1467699]

* Corrected potential platform-specific file path in Bible.AddBNames method.

-= 1.0 Beta 2 Baselevel 12 =-

* Scripture quick lookup fixes: Better handling of translations, book name parser modified to check all characters of the name input by the user. Added scripture_lookup/bad_reference/ambiguous to language file. [Bug 1467887]

* Fixed I18N issues on right-click menu in edit fields.  Added to language file: shared/cut, shared/copy, shared/paste.

* In presentation preferences, the "blanks before/after" radio buttons disable if "add blanks" isn't selected.

* Adding songs on-the-fly doesn't add unwanted blanks.

* When adding songs on-the-fly and using the "type to search" feature, pressing Escape before the search times out (1.5 seconds) will reset the search.  Pressing Escape when a search is not in progress will close the window.

* Program will display an error and not hang if the documents folder is mis-configured in Global Preferences [Bug 1204048]

* Multiple fixes in Song/Find to prevent crashes due to invalid song files. [Bug 1089442]

* Corrected "fencepost" error in preparing the set for presentation.  Error only became apparent if a custom slide with a slide style was the last slide in a set and the presentation preferences were set to insert blanks between set elements.

* Program won't silently crash when presenting a single item that has no title and no unique style.  Similar to Bug report 1077772.

* Slide transition starts at step 1 instead of step 2. [Bug 1484043]

* Print preview window closes when "Print" button is selected.  Will reappear if the printer dialog box is cancelled. This applies to all platforms even though the report was filed as Mac-specific. [Bug 1511623]

* Page break doesn't show as slide in presentation mode. [Bug 1515605]

* Moved parameters for controlling debug output to environment variables.  OPENSONGDEBUG controls whether debug output is enabled ("True" = Enabled); OPENSONGDEBUGFILE is the filename, relative to the application's folder ("Debug.txt" is default); OPENSONGDEBUGLEVEL is the maximum level to log (default = 1).

* Tried to fix (again) the issues with getting Windows to print multiple times during program execution.

* Fixed page metric calculations that resulted in a program hang if the printer settings file used points instead of inches (new format).

* Added attempted fix for randomly disappearing vertical scroll bar in song editor.  This is an "attempted fix" because there is no apparent reason for it disappearing other than a bug in RealBasic.

* HTML parsing for CCLI Import changed to delete any text outside the <html></html> tags.

* Corrected multiple errors in song rename.  Would incorrectly error if new name matched a song in another folder.  Would allow path characters in target filename.  Wouldn't sort the song list to reflect the proper position for the renamed song.

* I18N error messages for rename errors added or used.  Added errors/path_not_allowed and errors/rename_error to language file.

-= 1.0 Beta 2 Baselevel 11 -=

* Print copy count calculated accurately on Mac OS X. [Bug 1467395]

* Current Folder edit field clears on folder change (lst_songs_songs.Change will update it to match the selected song).

* Find will now start at the currently-selected song (or the first song if none is selected) and wrap the search from the beginning. [Bug 1458961]

* Find will not crash OpenSong if an invalid XML file is encountered.  An informational dialog box is posted showing the name of the offending file.

* Corrected issues related to the proper handling of songs and sets when switching modes and not saving unsaved edits. [Bug 14588972]

* Preferences dialogs (main program, print, presentation) save settings when dialog is accepted instead of waiting for a normal program exit. [Bug 1462055]

* Resize box removed from PresentWindow on Macintosh. [Bug 1467726]

* Directories in the OpenSong Languages folder are ignored in the General Settings/OpenSong Preferences window. [Bug 1467834]

* [Win/Linux] General Settings menu item moved to top of list.

* To make window management on Windows platforms more consistent when moving between programs while in Presenter mode, the main window will hide for the duration of the presentation. [Bug 1467746]

* Quick find (typing in the first few characters) in the Songs pane and Add Songs dialogs accepts non-ASCII input such as accented letters. [Bug 1460927]

* Add Songs in Set Mode now distinguishes between songs with the same name in two different folders.

* Vertical scaling of main slide text is now applied in all conditions.  A previous optimization to skip re-wrapping and horizontal scaling also skipped vertical scaling. [Bug 1468106]

* Set>Save As no longer saves the modifications to the original set as well. [Bug 1488275]

* When the Song Lookup window opens (hotkey "Q" in presenter mode), the list of songs will get focus immediately, so the operator will not have to click on the song list before starting to type.

* In Song Lookup window, the Escape key will reset the incremental search.

* In the song editor, the Escape key will reset the incremental search of the list of songs when focus is on the list.

* Song>Save now saves to the correct file when a file with the same name is in a higher folder in the folder hierarchy.

* Print Preview shows margin at the correct scale when the magnification factor is not 100%. [Bug 1473521]

* Print Settings dialog handles regional settings for decimal point and thousands separator for both input and output. [Bug 1473521]

* Window management when presenting is more consistent.  Presentation Helper window is now a document window, which means it has an icon in the taskbar on Windows.  It will resist being closed while a presentation is in progress.  Additionally, the main window will minimize on Windows (and hide on Mac) while the presentation is in progress. [Bug 1479332]

* Linux systems with dual screens set up as one X-Windows display (i.e., nVidia TwinView) will act more reasonably WRT window management.

* Starting a presentation will not hide the taskbar on Windows or the menubar on Macintosh unless in single screen mode or dual screen mode with the lowest numbered screen selected as the presentation screen.

* The taskbar (Windows) or menubar (Macintosh) will be hidden during a presentation only if the presentation window is the primary monitor. [Bug 1521079]

* The presentation helper window (control window) will show the slide text in the notes field if there are no slide notes.  In some cases this can be easier for the user to read than the slide preview.

* Require confirmation for revert and print all songs. [Request 1528693]

-= 1.0 Beta 2 Baselevel 10 -=

* Corrected issue with presentation window not appearing on the proper screen when the user selects to display it on the first screen defined by the OS in a multi-screen environment.  [Bug 1463669]

* Printer margin setup now retains setting of inches/centimeters option. [Bug 1458492]

* OpenSong won't crash on Windows when trying to print for the second time.

-= 1.0 Beta 2 Baselevel 9 -=

* When focus is on the songs list in the song editor, ALT/Command + keystroke now correctly invokes the menu or other action tied to that accelerator [Bug 1456869]

* Rearranged Song Advanced Edit page to put the song key field immediately below the Capo fields.

* Maximized caption width for all captions/radio buttons/select boxes on the main window to reduce clipping in non-English versions.

* Corrected inconsistent presentation behavior when there are additional characters after the closing bracket on a section header [Bug 1460921].

* Fixed presentation hotkeys for movement within a song so that starting on the blank before and pressing V or 1 to get to the first verse now moves to the correct slide.  Made all movement hotkeys consistent so that if a section occurs more than once (for example, V1, C, V2, C), pressing that key ("C" in this example) will always move to the next occurrence of that section/slide. [Bug 1464590]

* Fixed a UI issue to properly clear unused fields in set mode when switching from editing a song to editing a custom slide. [Bug 1462707]

* Fixed a UI issue where clicking the Save button for the current item in Set mode wouldn't disable the button.

* Moved Song Folder selection dropdown and related create/delete buttons above the song list.  Not only does this prevent confusion with this and the Containing Folder field, it also is more consistent with the Sets UI.

-= 1.0 Beta 2 Baselevel 8 -=


* Edit menu commands don't ever enable.  Created new EditField subclass SEditField that changes the Enabled state on Cut/Paste/Clear/Copy in its EnableMenus event.  Added menu handlers.  Added Edit>Select All menu item.  Changed superclass on all EditFields in MainWindow to SEditField. [Bug 1453562]

* Corrected issue printing chord lines without lyrics where preview is accurate but the printed output isn't. [Bug 1456327]  Also corrected same issue for comments.

* Blank slides within a song show the song's header and footer [Bug 1453812]

* Added status bar to ProgressWindow to allow the program to provide feedback to the user when a long activity is executing.

* Added an optional ability to cancel an operation when the ProgressWindow has focus.

* Corrected issue where printing all songs would display the progress window, but never update it.

* Added print/create_list to language file.

* Added errors/no_such_song to language file.

* Fixed program hang when printing a song where the width of the title and author exceeded the printable page width [Bugs 1455146, 1454788]

* Printing a song with multi-verse formatting (verse numbers at the beginning of the line) now prints the verse numbers in the proper font size.

* Songs list box in main window now properly tracks which folder contains a given entry, correcting an issue where two songs with the same name in different folders would display, but only one could be edited.

-= 0.9.9 =-
* Fixed version check bug. (bug #999077)
* Fixed logo oversize bug. (bug #999163)
* Fixed subtle scrolling bug in presentation helper window.
