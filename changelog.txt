* Multiple fixes in Song/Find to prevent crashes due to invalid song files. [Bug 1089442]

* Program won't silently crash when presenting a single item that has no title and no unique style.  Similar to Bug report 1077772.

* Slide transition starts at step 1 instead of step 2. [Bug 1484043]

* Print preview window closes when "Print" button is selected.  Will reappear if the printer dialog box is cancelled. This applies to all platforms even though the report was filed as Mac-specific. [Bug 1511623]

* Page break doesn't show as slide in presentation mode. [Bug 1515605]

* Moved parameters for controlling debug output to environment variables.  OPENSONGDEBUG controls whether debug output is enabled ("True" = Enabled); OPENSONGDEBUGFILE is the filename, relative to the application's folder ("Debug.txt" is default); OPENSONGDEBUGLEVEL is the maximum level to log (default = 1).

* Tried to fix (again) the issues with getting Windows to print multiple times during program execution.

* Fixed page metric calculations that resulted in a program hang if the printer settings file used points instead of inches (new format).

* Added attempted fix for randomly disappearing vertical scroll bar in song editor.  This is an "attempted fix" because there is no apparent reason for it disappearing other than a bug in RealBasic.

* HTML parsing for CCLI Import changed to delete any text outside the <html></html> tags.

* Corrected multiple errors in song rename.  Would incorrectly error if new name matched a song in another folder.  Would allow path characters in target filename.  Wouldn't sort the song list to reflect the proper position for the renamed song.

* I18N error messages for rename errors added or used.  Added errors/path_not_allowed and errors/rename_error to language file.

-= 1.0 Beta 2 Baselevel 11 -=

* Print copy count calculated accurately on Mac OS X. [Bug 1467395]

* Current Folder edit field clears on folder change (lst_songs_songs.Change will update it to match the selected song).

* Find will now start at the currently-selected song (or the first song if none is selected) and wrap the search from the beginning. [Bug 1458961]

* Find will not crash OpenSong if an invalid XML file is encountered.  An informational dialog box is posted showing the name of the offending file.

* Add Songs in Set Mode now distinguishes between songs with the same name in two different folders.

* Vertical scaling of main slide text is now applied in all conditions.  A previous optimization to skip re-wrapping and horizontal scaling also skipped vertical scaling. [Bug 1468106]

* Set>Save As no longer saves the modifications to the original set as well. [Bug 1488275]

* When the Song Lookup window opens (hotkey "Q" in presenter mode), the list of songs will get focus immediately, so the operator will not have to click on the song list before starting to type.

* In Song Lookup window, the Escape key will reset the incremental search.

* In the song editor, the Escape key will reset the incremental search of the list of songs when focus is on the list.

* Song>Save now saves to the correct file when a file with the same name is in a higher folder in the folder hierarchy.

* Print Preview shows margin at the correct scale when the magnification factor is not 100%. [Bug 1473521]

* Print Settings dialog handles regional settings for decimal point and thousands separator for both input and output. [Bug 1473521]

* Window management when presenting is more consistent.  Presentation Helper window is now a document window, which means it has an icon in the taskbar on Windows.  It will resist being closed while a presentation is in progress.  Additionally, the main window will minimize on Windows (and hide on Mac) while the presentation is in progress. [Bug 1479332]

* Linux systems with dual screens set up as one X-Windows display (i.e., nVidia TwinView) will act more reasonably WRT window management.

* Starting a presentation will not hide the taskbar on Windows or the menubar on Macintosh unless in single screen mode or dual screen mode with the lowest numbered screen selected as the presentation screen.

* The taskbar (Windows) or menubar (Macintosh) will be hidden during a presentation only if the presentation window is the primary monitor. [Bug 1521079]

* The presentation helper window (control window) will show the slide text in the notes field if there are no slide notes.  In some cases this can be easier for the user to read than the slide preview.

* Require confirmation for revert and print all songs. [Request 1528693]

-= 1.0 Beta 2 Baselevel 10 -=

* Corrected inconsistent presentation behavior when there are additional characters after the closing bracket on a section header [Bug 1460921].

* Fixed presentation hotkeys for movement within a song so that starting on the blank before and pressing V or 1 to get to the first verse now moves to the correct slide.  Made all movement hotkeys consistent so that if a section occurs more than once (for example, V1, C, V2, C), pressing that key ("C" in this example) will always move to the next occurrence of that section/slide. [Bug 1464590]

* Fixed a UI issue to properly clear unused fields in set mode when switching from editing a song to editing a custom slide. [Bug 1462707]

* Fixed a UI issue where clicking the Save button for the current item in Set mode wouldn't disable the button.

* Moved Song Folder selection dropdown and related create/delete buttons above the song list.  Not only does this prevent confusion with this and the Containing Folder field, it also is more consistent with the Sets UI.

-= 1.0 Beta 2 Baselevel 8 -=


* Edit menu commands don't ever enable.  Created new EditField subclass SEditField that changes the Enabled state on Cut/Paste/Clear/Copy in its EnableMenus event.  Added menu handlers.  Added Edit>Select All menu item.  Changed superclass on all EditFields in MainWindow to SEditField. [Bug 1453562]

* Printing a song with multi-verse formatting (verse numbers at the beginning of the line) now prints the verse numbers in the proper font size.

* Songs list box in main window now properly tracks which folder contains a given entry, correcting an issue where two songs with the same name in different folders would display, but only one could be edited.

* Fixed scripture bug when adding a range of verses: occasionally returned only the first verse.
* Changed auto-insert blanks to a checkbox. To keep OpenSong from inserting a blank slide between custom slides, give your custom slides the same name. This should make more sense and work fine for the few people who need it that way.
* The live "Quick Scripture" feature now presents verses live from the scripture chooser rather than statically adding the scripture to the set. (feature request #1007482)
* Songs can now be exported to HTML.
* Image chooser is now bigger and cooler.

* Many bug fixes!

-= 0.9.7 =-
* Added "Copy" button to set items. (feature request #959279)
* Added a new "Style Change" set item type for changing (or reverting) a set's style mid-way through a presentation. This is a very cool feature once you figure out how to use it. (Thanks Brad)

* Fixed a bug in the transposer causing it to not work properly on Windows 98. (Thanks Eugene)

* Creating, renaming, and deleting sets is now faster. When creating a new set, it is automatically selected. When renaming a set, it remains selected.
* Aesthetic updates: added Presentation mode as a popup menu of the Present buttons rather than as a seperate drop-down list. Also added an "Esc = Exit Presentation" label in PresentHelper. Rearranged the Present Settings dialog box.
* When in black, white, or clear mode during presentations, the preview window now still shows the slide content but with a border and slash through it so you can still see what would be presented in normal mode.

* Improved calculation of page margins when printing.
* Fixed a couple random, tiny, "unnoticeable" bugs.

-= 0.8.1 =-
* Pressing "A" during presentations now pops up the alert window. Entering an alert displays it in the bottom right-hand corner of the presentation. Entering an empty alert clears the alert.

* Default backgrounds folder when changing background is now OpenSong\Backgrounds, not My Documents.
* OpenSong now includes a default background image
